**Is your feature request related to a problem?

"I'm always frustrated when it comes to setting up Content Attachment URL's in project "wiConAppfi" would be an App. where people would be able to save internet data from their homes router and can be used throughout the day or when they can get any phone reception. It would need Internet providers approveble I believe, or app needs to be redirected to routers internet providers url."

**Describe alternatives you've considered**
